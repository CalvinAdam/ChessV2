# ChessV2

This algorithm is a minimax algorithm designed to play chess. To use it simply copy all files into a folder and run main.py. It uses an opening library for the first couple moves,
which can either be seperately made with the import_data.py file (it constructs the database out of standard .pgn files) or the premade opening_moves_100000.pkl file can be used. 
It uses pygame as a GUI.
